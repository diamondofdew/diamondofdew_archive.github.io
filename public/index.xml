      <title>The stone rejected by the builders</title>

      <description>“The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. This is the LORD’s doing; it is wonderful in our eyes.”
In these powerful words of Psalm 118, the earliest disciples of Jesus found the key to understanding the mystery of Christ Crucified and the still greater mystery of Christ Risen.
As the world continues to battle our most recent pandemic, we remember the many faces of Christ Crucified throughout the ages, from those thrown away to die in the streets, to those herded into extermination camps; from those abused by family, friends or clergy, to those whose dreams and ambitions have utterly failed.</description>

      <description>On Good Friday, there was no Eucharist - simply a communion service, with the Body of Christ from the Holy Thursday Eucharist.
On Holy Saturday, there is no liturgy at all. The liturgy this evening is the vigil - the preparation for and entry into the celebration of Our Lord&amp;rsquo;s Resurrection. It is an Easter Sunday liturgy. On Holy Saturday we enter into the mystery. Today we contemplate Jesus, there in the tomb, dead.</description>

      <description>Good Friday of the Lord&#39;s Passion Year A 2020Isaiah 52:13--53:12Psalms 31:2, 6, 12-13, 15-16, 17, 25Hebrews 4:14-16; 5:7-9John 18:1--19:42What started as like jokes worldwide have made the world to become a very strange place as we respond to COVID-19.
We never knew it will look like this as we arrive at Good Friday on April 10, 2020. At this point, in most places around the world, Triduum in Catholic churches will look much different than it usually does.</description>

      <description>Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper Year A 2020Exodus 12:1-8, 11-14Psalm 116:12-13, 15-16bc, 17-181 Corinthians 11:23-26John 13:1-15This evening we begin the holy days of the Paschal Triduum, ending Lent and walking with Jesus to his death and resurrection. These days are about Jesus. But, we too, in the company of Jesus, have our part in the story. Why? Because, we live daily the Paschal Mystery of Life, Death and Resurrection.</description>

      <description>Wednesday of Holy Week Year A 2020Isaiah 50:4-9APsalms 69:8-10, 21-22, 31 and 33-34Matthew 26:14-25Holy Week, 2020, and a pandemic rages across the world. Go back 102 years to April, 1918 (Easter was on March 31 that year) and the inception of what would become the world-wide flu pandemic. An April public health document reported severe flu cases and several deaths, social distancing was not widespread, and deaths spiked significantly in the U.</description>

      <title>Are we truly fulfilling God’s plan for our life?</title>

      <description>Tuesday of Holy Week Year A 2020Isaiah 49:1-6Psalms 71:1-2, 3-4A, 5AB-6AB, 15 and 17John 13:21-33, 36-38While that question should be a key focus for each of us each and every day, is it really something we should contemplate during Holy Week? Yet today’s readings certainly seem to point us back to that fundamental issue.
In the first reading for today, we see a clear picture that God had a plan for Isaiah from the very beginning of his life.</description>

      <description>Monday of Holy Week Year A 2020Isaiah 42:1-7Psalms 27:1, 2, 3, 13-14John 12:1-11One of the most significant and powerful gifts that one person can share with another is the gift of compassion.
Compassion rises from deep within and becomes an almost unstoppable movement toward someone in response to their pain. We respond with love in a gesture of care and a meaningful, sacred encounter emerges.
In our gospel story today, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, who are friends of Jesus, host a dinner for him.</description>

      <description>Passion Sunday, Year A, 2020Isaiah 50:4-7Philippians 2:6-11Matthew 26:14—27:66Today we enter into Holy Week. The week is made holy by its celebration of Jesus&amp;rsquo; gift of himself to us and for us. Wednesday, we remember his betrayal. Thursday is a celebration of the gift of the Eucharist and a reflection on the example of service Jesus gives to us. Friday is &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo; because we truly remember how much he loved us - even with his death on the cross.</description>

      <description>Saturday of the Fifth Week of Lent Year A 2020Ezekiel 37:21-28Jeremiah 31:10, 11-12ABCD, 13John 11:45-56In today’s gospel and we are reminded of what is coming. We rejoice in the great love of Jesus for us. Our Lenten journey has brought us here.
It is as though we, too, are gathering in Jerusalem to celebrate our Passover week.
We are ready to enter into the Passion drama, and to celebrate the Paschal Mystery, with mind and heart renewed.</description>

      <description>Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent Year A 2020Jeremiah 20:10-13Psalms 18:2-3SA, 3BC-4, 5-6, 7John 10:31-42In the current culture few people reach the age of 21 years without experiencing some of the anxiety and terror that the first reading expresses today. It is as if everywhere one looks, someone seems to have it in for others – is prepared to make life miserable for no just cause.</description>

      <description>Thursday of the Fifth Week of Lent Year A 2020Genesis 17:3-9Psalms 105:4-5, 6-7, 8-9John 8:51-59In last Monday’s gospel reading, the religious leaders were ready to stone a woman whom they had brought to Jesus. In this morning’s gospel reading, the same group pick up stones in order to stone Jesus. They wanted to stone the woman because she had sinned by committing adultery; they wanted to stone Jesus because of the claims that he was making for himself, such as his claim that he existed before Abraham was born.</description>

What is sometimes put out as the truth is not always the full truth. One particular slant on an issue can easily be presented as the full truth. Full truth does not come our way easily; we have to keep on seeking the truth.</description>

      <description>Tuesday of the Fifth Week of Lent Year A 2020Numbers 21:4-9Psalms 102:2-3, 16-18, 19-21John 8:21-30The words in the psalm today should be the words of our prayers during this global pandemic of COVID-19. Looking around the world, in some places some have lived weeks working from home, while some are experiencing restricted movements, lockdown and respecting the physical distancing expectations. In checking in with, friends, and family near and far, there is a mix of emotions – overwhelmed, relieved to be safe or secure in their jobs, sad to be missing friends and family, mourning the loss of loved ones, not to attend to as to issues promptly, not sure what tomorrow would be, cancellations of weddings, and other celebrations that will not be what was imagined, scared, anxious, etc.</description>

This is another one of John’s gospel demonstrating the mercy of God. God is not interested in our past but what the future will be.</description>

For example, how often do we remember the meaning of grace/hope which we learnt in our Catechism classes – “Grace is the supernatural gift of God which makes us believe that God will do everything for our justification and salvation.</description>

      <description>Saturday of the Fourth Week of Lent Year A 2020Jeremiah 11:18-20Psalms 7:2-3, 9bc-10, 11-12John 7:40-53Today&amp;rsquo;s readings are both about recognizing God and responding appropriately to God.
In the preceding passages in Jeremiah, God told Jeremiah to remind the people that they have ignored God&amp;rsquo;s covenant and rules. They ignore God and they ignore God&amp;rsquo;s messenger and worship false gods. In today&amp;rsquo;s reading they want to eliminate Jeremiah who was reminder to them of their evil ways.</description>

      <description>Friday of the Fourth Week of Lent Year 2020Wisdom 2:1a, 12-22Psalms 34:17-1, 19-20, 21 and 23John 7:1-2, 10, 25-30The Book of Wisdom from which our first reading came was written less than one hundred years before the coming of Jesus. It is probably closer to the time of Jesus than any other book of the Old Testament.
In our reading, the author places a little speech on the lips of those who were hostile to people of faith, those who took their Jewish faith seriously.</description>

Then the LORD said to Moses: Go down at once because your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have acted corruptly.

      <description>Solemnity of the Annunciation of the LordIsaiah 7:10-14; 8:10Psalms 40:7-8A, 8B-9, 10, 11Hebrews 10:4-10Luke 1:26-38Just when people think they have God figured out, that they know what God wants from them, God instead surprises them.
In the first reading, the Lord tells Ahaz to ask for a sign, but Ahaz, based on his preconceived ideas about how God operates, refuses. To do what God asks would violate what he believes God prefers.</description>

This would especially be true in the arid surroundings of the temple.
Our guide down this miraculous river seems to wade, float, and then swim with us until we, overwhelmed by the power and depth of the water, clamber onto a lush bank.</description>

They had returned home to a land and a city that was in ruins. At such a moment, the prophet speaks a message of hope from the Lord, ‘I create new heavens and a new earth, and the past will not be remembered… I now create Jerusalem “Joy” and her people “Gladness”’.</description>

But the light of the sun is not the only light that is available to make our days more enjoyable, for we can also choose to walk in the light of the Lord.</description>

      <description>Saturday of the Third Week of Lent Year A 2020*Hosea 6:1-6.Psalm 51:3-4.18-19.20-21ab.Luke 18:9-14.In both readings today, there is a contrast between what God wants and what people bring him.
In the first reading, the people bring sacrifices and holocausts to God in the Temple, but in response God, speaking through the prophet Hosea, says, ‘what I want is love, not sacrifice; knowledge of God, not holocausts’. God wants the love of his people, a love that finds expression in the love of others.</description>

We hear in the text the voice of a loving God, who has entered a covenant relationship with chosen humans that is analogous to the commitment of spouses to one another.</description>

      <description>Wednesday of the Third Week of Lent Year A 2020Deuteronomy 4:1, 5-9Psalms 147:12-13, 15-16, 19-20Matthew 5:17-19As a Catholic, a parent/teacher, not an accomplished theologian, I find one of the most inspirational qualities of the Gospels of our faith to be their simplicity.
What I mean is that as the master teacher, Jesus does what we all strive to do as parents/teachers, which is to make complex and abstract concepts more accessible and understandable for the Children/students.</description>

      <description>Tuesday of the Third Week of Lent Year A 2020Daniel 3:2.11-20.Psalm 25:4-5ab.6; 7cd. 8-9.Matthew 18:21-35.We venerate Patrick on this his feast day because he spent himself in proclaiming the gospel on this island, bringing Christ to huge numbers of people. He says of himself in his Confessions, &amp;ldquo;The love of Christ gave me to these people to serve them humbly and sincerely for my entire lifetime&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Monday of the Third Week of Lent Year A 20202 Kings 5:1-15abPsalms 42:2, 3, 43:3,4 Luke 4:24-30Today&amp;rsquo;s Lenten readings seem to be about letting God heal us.
Naaman hears there is a prophet in this foreign land who could cure his skin disease. The trouble is, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like what Elisha suggests for his healing. His logic goes: The rivers of my home in Damascus, Syria, would have been just fine to wash in.</description>

      <description>Third Sunday of Lent Year A 2020Exodus 17:3-7Psalms 95:1-2, 6-7, 8-9Romans 5:1-2, 5-8John 4:5-42We talk about Lent as a time of invitation from God. What does God want to give us this Lent?
We begin by looking at the story of a woman who sees how she can change her life; how she can change the patterns of her life. She leaves behind her fears and her embarrassment and begins a new life – she sees that God has an invitation for her and she says, Yes!</description>

Rightly understood we realize the story focuses on the prodigality of God and God’s mercy more than it focuses on the immature and self-driven decisions of the sinner (child) in the story.</description>

      <description>Wednesday of the Second Week of Lent Year AJeremiah 18:18-20Psalms 31:5-6, 14, 15-16Matthew 20:17-28We often find in the Jewish Scriptures that those who are in some dire situation address an agonizing question to God. One such example is to be found in today’s first reading. In response to those who are plotting his downfall, Jeremiah asks God, &amp;ldquo;Should evil be returned for good?&amp;quot; Although, in theory, we would answer ‘no’ to Jeremiah’s question, in practice we are all aware that evil is often returned for good.</description>

Jesus was not opposed to some form of leadership among his own followers.</description>

      <description>Monday of the Second Week of Lent Year A 2020Daniel 94B-10Psalms 798, 9, 11 and 13Luke 636-38We live in such an individualistic society. We may be part of a church, club, or family but it is easy for many to disown the group when things are not as they should be.
The first reading from the Book of Daniel is one of the great acts of sorrow to God for sin in the Bible.</description>

In the Old Testament tradition, where God led his enslaved children from Egypt to the Promised Land, the pillar of Cloud showed God’s presence while he travelled with his people — a traveling God.</description>

 In a time of polarizing partisanship with name-calling and filter bubbles, I tend to wrap myself in indignation and superiority over those I consider wrong and against what I stand for.</description>

      <description>Friday of the first week in Lent Year A 2020Ezekiel 18:21-28Psalm 130:1-8Matthew 5:20-26No one likes to be told what to do. In general, we dislike laws and regulations. Rules can vary from being annoying to stifling to burdensome. As a result, we try to find ways to avoid following the rules and look for short cut. We ask ourselves how we can get away with doing the minimum.</description>

The prayer of Queen Esther in today’s first reading is a very simple powerful prayer of someone in mortal peril, especially the final petition of her prayer, &amp;ldquo;come to my help, for I am alone and have no one but you, Lord&amp;rdquo;, reminds us to pray for courage when we are afraid.</description>

      <description>Wednesday of the First Week in Lent Year A 2020 Jonah 3:1-10 Psalms 51:3-4, 12-13, 18-19 Luke 11:29-32When I see any reference to Jonah, I think of the story of the little girl who in Sunday school was mesmerized with the account of Jonah being swallowed by a whale and spending three days and nights in the whale’s belly. The next day in science class, she very excitedly recounts the story to her science teacher.</description>

The first reading in Isaiah today tells us that we can trust God’s word to be a fertile and fruitful seed that will achieve God’s ends.</description>

Only yesterday, lost in my musings, I almost walked into a woman in tattered clothing on the street She is startled and says, &amp;ldquo;I am sorry&amp;rdquo;. I smile and say, “I’m sorry, too.” I walk on. I don’t see her again, but I can’t get her off my mind because in our world today, ordinarily nobody will want to say sorry.</description>

When “prosperity gospel” is not preached, on a Sunday, then “end times prediction” is the next viable topic of interest among evangelists and prophets.</description>

      <description>Saturday after Ash Wednesday Year A 2020Isaiah 58:9-14Luke 5:27-32In the first reading, what the Lord is telling His people is certainly something that is not beyond their reach or impossible to achieve. It is the very basics of being human – doing away with the yoke, the clenched fist, the wicked word, giving bread to the hungry, relief to the oppressed. In return, they will be like a watered garden, a spring of water, called “Breach-mender” and “Restorer of ruined houses”.</description>

      <description>Friday after Ash Wednesday Year A 2020Isaiah 58: 1 - 9Matthew 9: 14 - 15Fasting as a form of penance is often highlighted during the Lenten Season. On Ash Wednesday, we talked about fasting and doing penance. Today’s reading also talked about fasting.
In the first reading prophet Isaiah pointed out to the people that they abused and misused the religious meaning of fasting. They practised fasting but their lives did not reflect the act of doing penance.</description>

Not that I am bothered anyway – it was an outward sign pointing to an inward effect. It called us to repentance and conversion, while reminding us where we shall go after now.
By now the ashes must have left our foreheads too – sweat, wind, morning shower, or an overnight transfer onto our pillows.</description>

It is a journey of repentance, a journey of renewal, a journey of conversion and a journey of healing. Whatever forms the journey may take, it is always a journey back into the heart of God. It is not just today but even for the whole season of Lent, that we are called to deepen our spiritual life with penance and repentance.</description>
