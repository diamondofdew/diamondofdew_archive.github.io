          <pre><code>Good Friday of the Lord's Passion Year A 2020

Isaiah 52:13--53:12
Psalms 31:2, 6, 12-13, 15-16, 17, 25
Hebrews 4:14-16; 5:7-9
John 18:1--19:42

</code></pre><p>What started as like jokes worldwide have made the world to become a very strange place as we respond to COVID-19.</p>
<p>We never knew it will look like this as we arrive at Good Friday on April 10, 2020.  At this point, in most places around the world, Triduum in Catholic churches will look much different than it usually does. We are not celebrating these highest of our holy days in the places of worship that have held our prayer at this touchstone moment in the liturgical year. We cannot even celebrate in the same physical place as the people we usually pray with on these days. (Thank God for the technology that allows us to pray together in virtual space.)</p>
<p>Let us be encouraged to read the entire psalm text. In the antiphon (Ps 31:6) we repeat Jesus’ last words on the cross in the Gospel of Luke (23:46): <em>“Into your hands I commend my spirit.”</em> Jesus (and Luke’s community) surely knew what came next: <em>“You will redeem me, Lord, God of truth.”</em> In lament, the psalmist describes the suffering and intense fear and anxiety that Jesus was surely experiencing as well: <em>“I am in distress; affliction is wearing down my eyes, my throat, and my insides. My life is worn out by sorrow.”</em> And always, the psalmist remembers their trust in God: <em>“I trust in you, LORD; I say, ‘You are my God.’”</em>  The psalm ends, <em>“Be strong and take heart, all who hope in the Lord.”</em></p>
<p>At the darkest moment of our salvation history, the moment the most fully human person chose to enter into the deepest human uncertainty, that Person cried out with a song of surrender, trust, and hope.</p>
<p>What do we surrender into God’s hands today?</p>
<p>We know this story; death is not the end and Resurrection is coming soon. Still, we may  find ourselves in a similar spiritual place to Jesus’ disciples on that Good Friday. Their world had been turned upside down, their expectations for the future suddenly changed. They were afraid and uncertain of the future. How could this be real? How were they supposed to live in this new reality? They had to re-learn how to trust God.</p>
<p>How are we re-learning how to trust God in our time?</p>
<h2 id="reflect">Reflect</h2>
<p>Why does the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross showcase the greatest love.</p>
<h2 id="prayer">Prayer</h2>
<p>My Lord,
Your Son has suffered so much, shed so much blood.<br>
We were born with so many faults and our nature is so full of weakness, and yet your Son Jesus has died on the cross for us.<br>
We know your grace has the power to cleanse us of our many sins and to make us more like your Son.<br>
Thank you for your goodness and love for us.<br>
We ask you, Father, to watch over us always. 
<strong><em>May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil and bring us to everlasting life. Amen.</em></strong></p>
