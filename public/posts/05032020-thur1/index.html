          <pre><code>Thursday of the First Week in Lent Year A 2020

Esther C: 12, 14-16, 23-25
Psalms 138:1-2AB, 2CDE-3, 7C-8
Matthew 7:7-12
</code></pre><p>We are in the first full week of Lent, and today’s readings tell us not to be shy in our prayer, but to sincerely ask, and beg God for what we <em>need</em>.</p>
<p>The prayer of Queen Esther in today’s first reading is a very simple powerful prayer of someone in mortal peril, especially the final petition of her prayer, <em>&ldquo;come to my help, for I am alone and have no one but you, Lord&rdquo;</em>, reminds us to pray for courage when we are afraid. She is a powerful woman, a queen, but at this desperate moment in her life she recognizes that she is completely powerless and totally dependent on the Lord alone for help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can come a time in all of our lives when we recognize that if the Lord does not help me no one will. These are moments when our total dependence on the Lord for our personal survival is crystal clear to us. We come before the Lord in our poverty, our vulnerability, and in desperation we cry for his help. This is the kind of prayer out the depths of mortal peril that the Lord never fails to answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In speaking of this gospel Pope Francis noted, <em>“That’s an almost incredible guarantee that our prayers will always be heard.&quot;</em> But, Francis continued, <em>“He doesn’t tell us ‘Ask and you’ll get whatever you ask for.’ He instructs us to seek but he doesn’t tell us exactly what we’ll find. He tells us to knock but he doesn’t say what will be waiting for us on the other side of the opened door. But he promises us that our prayers will be heard and God will respond.”</em></p>
<p>Yet many of us will have had the experience of our prayers of petition not being answered. The prayer of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane; His prayer of petition began, <em>&ldquo;let this cup pass from me&rdquo;</em>, but it concluded, <em>&ldquo;your will be done&rdquo;</em>. At that point, the prayer of petition becomes the prayer of surrender, and this is surely the deepest form of prayer.</p>
<p>Saint Paul had that experience too. He suffered from what he called a ‘thorn in the flesh’ and three times, he said, he appealed to the Lord to be rid of it, but his prayer was not heard. He was left with his thorn in the flesh. Yet, the Lord did respond to his prayer, even though not in the way Paul was looking for. The Lord said to Paul in response to his prayer, <em>&ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Paul’s experience teaches us to trust that our prayer of petition is never wasted; the Lord will respond to us, even if not in the way we wanted or hoped for. We have to keep on asking, searching, knocking, trusting that in doing so we are giving the Lord space to work in our lives. Sometimes we have to be in dire straits, like Queen Esther, to realize how much we need the Lord. <strong>It is often moments of greatest weakness that open us up most fully to the Lord’s ‘faithfulness and love’</strong>, in the language of today’s responsorial psalm.</p>
<p>So, while we don’t know how our prayers will be answered, we do know they will be heard. Our faith tells us that God is really listening to us. <strong>And this might be the year to reframe the season of Lent, from one of “giving up something” to one of asking God what gift he wants to give us this Lent.</strong> Instead of a focus on what I am doing for Lent, we can open our hearts to God and listen to what gift, what healing God offers us this Lent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can knock on the door; we can seek and ask for the help to love more generously. If we can pray with that every day in Lent and make that our Lent commitment, that will deepen our experience of Lent and our own relationship with Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prayer">Prayer</h2>
<p>Loving God, I want to do everything myself, but like Esther, I realize I have no help but you. Please give me the strength and courage to be more loving and open in all of my relationships this Lent. Give me a listening heart to hear you speak to me when I knock through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
