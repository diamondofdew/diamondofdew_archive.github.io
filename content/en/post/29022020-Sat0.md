Isaiah 58:9-14
Luke 5:27-32

```

In the first reading, what the Lord is telling His people is certainly something that is not beyond their reach or impossible to achieve. It is the very basics of being human – doing away with the yoke, the clenched fist, the wicked word, giving bread to the hungry, relief to the oppressed. In return, they will be like a watered garden, a spring of water, called _“Breach-mender”_ and _“Restorer of ruined houses”_.

In the gospel it wasn’t rocket-science either, but only a conviction and commitment on the part of Levi as Jesus called him.

In the season of Lent, we are called to practice the spiritual discipline of prayer, fasting and almsgiving. That is not difficult or impossible. But we must have the conviction and commitment. And what we will receive from the Lord would be a joy that is so unbounded that like Levi we will also call for a party to the glory of God.
