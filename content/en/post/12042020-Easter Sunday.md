_“The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. This is the LORD’s doing;  it is wonderful in our eyes.”_

In these powerful words of Psalm 118, the earliest disciples of Jesus found the key to understanding the mystery of Christ Crucified and the still greater mystery of Christ Risen. 

As the world continues to battle our most recent pandemic, we remember the many faces of Christ Crucified throughout the ages, from those thrown away to die in the streets, to those herded into extermination camps; from those abused by family, friends or clergy, to those whose dreams and ambitions have utterly failed. 

As we celebrate this Paschal Feast, let us join the very first disciples of the Risen Lord as we remember and contemplate these beautiful words: _what was rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone; by the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes._                           

## Excerpt of Easter Sequence
Death and life have contended in that combat stupendous:  
    The Prince of life, who died, reigns immortal.  
Speak, Mary, declaring  
    What you saw, wayfaring.  
“The tomb of Christ, who is living,  
    The glory of Jesus’ resurrection;  
bright angels attesting,  
    The shroud and napkin resting.  
Yes, Christ my hope is arisen;  
    to Galilee he goes before you.”
