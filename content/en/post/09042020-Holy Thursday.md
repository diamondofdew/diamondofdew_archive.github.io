Holy Thursday  
Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper Year A 2020

Exodus 12:1-8, 11-14
Psalm 116:12-13, 15-16bc, 17-18
1 Corinthians 11:23-26
John 13:1-15


```

This evening we begin the holy days of the Paschal Triduum, ending Lent and walking with Jesus to his death and resurrection. These days are about Jesus. But, we too, in the company of Jesus, have our part in the story. Why? 
**Because, we live daily the Paschal Mystery of Life, Death and Resurrection.**

As we pray with today’s readings, we can use our imagination and enter the scenes presented to us through Scripture.

Today, we recall God’s loving, ancient fidelity.  Let us be with Jesus in the breaking of bread, and as he washes and dries the feet of the apostles. How can we be with Jesus by being bread for others, and servant, as a sign, symbol and sacrament of Christ’s presence? To be Eucharist!  

Through our baptism, are we not anointed to be his presence and to carry on the work of the Gospel?  We were anointed to carry on all that we have been taught as disciples. We are invited to be as he was. Our lives are given and shared, broken and eaten in loving service and too, at times, sacrifice.

Also, today the sacred oils were blessed at the Chrism Mass. These oils are the sacramental sign and symbol for anointing at life’s important moments, recognizing God with us. These are times when we are blessed with the oils recognizing a sacramental, holy life at birth, illness, death, commitment, and the call we each have to discipleship, in whatever path we choose. The Spirit of the Lord is upon us because we have been anointed!

May this Easter Triduum be an opportunity to be with Jesus, as we hear his story, reflect on his arrest, betrayal, trial, death and pray with him into the joy of his resurrected presence — one day at a time. May we stand in awe of this great gift of the Paschal Mystery.
May we know God’s loving fidelity.

Jesus asks, _“Do you realize what I have done for you?”_

## Reflect
Compare how Christianity defines happiness with the opposite way our culture defines it.  
Which way are you practicing?




## Prayer

Loving Provider,  
You gather us in this upper room with your Son, to be fed by your love.  
At that supper, Jesus told us to "love one another" and we know that is the heart of his gift, his sacrifice for us.  
We ask that we might find the source of our own hearts, the meaning for our own lives, in that Eucharist.  
Guide us to the fullness of your love and life.    
**_May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil and bring us to everlasting life. Amen._**
