Monday of the First Week of Lent Year A 2020

Leviticus 19: 1-2, 11-18
Psalm 19: 8- 10, 15
Matthew 25:31-46

```

It’s Lent again. What will I give up versus what will I do? 

Only yesterday, lost in my musings, I almost walked into a woman in tattered clothing on the street She is startled and says, "I am sorry". I smile and say, “I’m sorry, too.” I walk on. I don’t see her again, but I can’t get her off my mind because in our world today, ordinarily nobody will want to say sorry.

>“WHEN WAS IT THAT WE SAW YOU A STRANGER AND WELCOMED YOU?” 

I thought, “But who can I call, where was she going?” and further rationalized, “She's out here, or she’d be in a shelter…”  

Merriam Webster defines “WELCOME” as “to greet someone in a warm, friendly manner.” Does Jesus define it as more? 
Maybe so. I take this conundrum to my daily Examen, to ponder with God.

## PRAYER
Jesus, I feel within me a great desire to please you  
but, at the same time,   
I feel totally incapable of doing this without your special light and help,  
which I can expect only from you.  
Accomplish your will within me— Even in spite of me. Amen.
